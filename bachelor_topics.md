### Representations of (some) Lie algebras

The Lie algebra 
${\frak sl}_2({\Bbb C})$ of all matrices whose trace is zero 
is a fundamental object in the study of Lie algebras and plays a crucial role in understanding more complicated structures. In addition to its significance in physics, it possesses a rich representation theory that serves as a blueprint for understanding more general cases.

### The Cauchy—Davenport theorem in finite groups 

Let $p$ be a prime number. If $A$ and $B$ are non-empty subsets of the set $\mathbb{Z}/p$ of integers modulo $p$, then 
$|A+B|\geq\min\lbrace p,|A|+|B|-1\rbrace$. 
This sharp bound is known as the Cauchy—Davenport theorem. 
Remarkably, the theorem can be generalized to any finite group!

### Chebyshev's curves and singular points 

A classical theorem in the theory of plane curves states an irreducible algebraic
curve $C$ of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{P}_2(\mathbb{C})$ 
has at most $\frac12(n-1)(n-2)$ singularities. It is a very natural question
to ask whether, for each $n$, there exists irreducible curves
of degree $n$ that have such maximal number of 
singularities. A concrete family of curves reaching that maximal 
number of singularities can be constructed using Chebyshev's polynomials.

### The Schur—Zassenhaus theorem

Given a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, can we reconstruct the structure of $G$ from that of $N$ and $G/N$? In general, no. However, there is a crucial case where this problem has a beautiful solution: If the orders of $N$ and $G/N$ are coprime, then $G$ is a semidirect product of $N$ and $G/N$. This is the celebrated Schur—Zassenhaus theorem. The proof is also enjoyable. It reduces the problem to the case where $N$ is abelian; in that case, one uses some basic group cohomology!

### Dedekind-finite rings

A ring is said to be a _Dedekind-finite_ ring if $ab = 1$ implies $ba = 1$ for any two elements $a$ and $b$. 
Several classes of rings are known to be Dedekind-finite. 
There is a beautiful theorem of Kaplansky that states that if an element of a 
ring has more than one right inverse, then it in fact has infinitely many.

### It is all about actions

The idea is to study an elementary theorem (yet compelling) proved not so long ago by Deaconescu and Walls about divisibility relations among the set of orbits of actions by group automorphisms. The theorem is very elementary and has friendly and highly non-trivial applications.

### Hall’s Marriage theorem

### Permutation polynomials

Let $K$ be a finite field (e.g., the field of integers modulo a prime number $p$). The project is about “permutation polynomials”.
A permutation polynomial $f(X)\in K[X]$ such that the associated function $x\mapsto f(x)$ is bijective. In 1966, Carlitz presented a conjecture that motivated around 30 years of intensive research in permutation polynomials. Although there was an immediate success in some special cases, progress was made slowly over the next three decades until Carlitz’s conjecture was finally resolved in the affirmative by Fried, Guralnick, and Saxl in 1993.

### Combinatorial Nullstellensatz

An algebraic approach to combinatorial problems involves capturing some combinatorial structures using polynomials and arguing about their algebraic properties. This has led to simple solutions to several long-standing open problems.  One of the main tools in this context is Alon’s combinatorial NullStellensatz. Examples of problems that can be solved with Alon’s theorem are the Cauchy—Davenport theorem, and Kakeya’s conjecture for finite fields.

### Cross products only in dimensions three and seven

### Zsigmondy's theorem

Zsigmondy’s theorem is a result that often proves useful in various number theory problems. 
It proves the existence of primitive divisors of numbers of the form $a^n-b^n$. And while this is an interesting result in itself, it is also a powerful trick for solving mathematical 
contest problems.

### The Golod—Shafarevich theorem

Golod and Shafarevich proved this significant result in 1964. It results in non-commutative algebra, which solves several challenging problems (e.g., the class field tower problem). In combinatorial group theory, finding a counterexample to the generalized Burnside problem is crucial: For each prime $p$, there is an infinite group $G$ generated by three elements in which each element has order a power of $p$.

### Kaplansky's conjectures in group rings

There are several open problems in ring theory known as Kaplansky’s conjectures.

### Far beyond the Cayley—Hamilton theorem

The Cayley--Hamilton theorem states that every square matrix satisfies its characteristic equation. 
The Amitsur--Levitzki theorem deals with products of $2k$ matrices of size $k^2$. 
The theorem is the starting point of a rich theory of rings with polynomial identities. 
(Interesting note: As a young man, Levitzki went to Göttingen to study chemistry, 
but attending a lecture by 
Emmy Noether converted him to mathematics.)

### Graph theory and the Amitsur—Levitski theorem

The Amitsur—Levitzki theorem states that 
$\sum sign(\sigma)A_{\sigma(1)}\cdots A_{\sigma(2n)}=0$
for all $A_1,\dots,A_{2n}\in M_n(\mathbb{C})$, where the sum is taken over all permutations of the symmetric group $\mathbb{S}_n$. 
There is a beautiful graph-theoretic proof of this surprising result.

FRACTRAN is a Turing-complete programming language invented by the mathematician John Conway. A FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive rational numbers and an initial positive integer. In this fantastic language, Conway learned how to write an astonishing prime number generator. Surprisingly, this FRACTRAN program is just a list of 14 rational numbers! There is also an interesting [video](https://www.uctv.tv/shows/Fractran-A-Ridiculous-Logical-Language-with-John-Conway-23320).

### The Jones polynomial

In 1984 Jones discovered a new invariant of knots. The invariant assigns to each oriented knot (or link)  
a Laurent polynomial with integer coefficients. This invariant is surprisingly simple and extremely 
powerful. And Jones’ discovery was crucial in solving some old-and-famous 
200-years-old conjectures.

### The (curious history of the) Schwartz—Zippel lemma

This topic is motivated by [this](https://rjlipton.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/) blog post. 
The fundamental question of identity testing is: given a polynomial $P(X_{1}, \dots, X_{n})$ of degree $d$, 
when is this polynomial identically zero? An interesting approach 
to this question appeared independently in the works of Schwartz, 
Zippel, De Millo and Lipton, 
and others. According to Lidl and Niederreiter, the first instance of this result 
was proven by Ore in 1922. The lemma also appears in the 
[PhD thesis](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/4061/1/Erickson_de_1974.pdf) 
of Daniel Erickson from 1974. This lemma now has several applications in pure mathematics.

### Herstein's theorem

A very nice theorem proved by Herstein

using the transfer map.

### An example of a P.I.D. that is not a Euclidean domain

It turns out that $R = \mathbb{Z}[ \frac12 (1 + \sqrt{−19})]$ is such an example. 
To show that $R$ has the desired properties, 
Campoli proves that the ring $R$ is, in his words, _almost euclidean_. It 
turns out that a ring is almost euclidean if and only if it is a principal ideal domain.

modulo $d$.

Lagrange's theorem states that every non-negative integer can 
be represented as a sum of four non-negative integer squares. 
A particularly elegant proof of this result can be found

It can also be proved using quaternions and 
ideas similar to those we studied in 
the bachelor course _Ring and Module Theory_.

### The inverse Galois problem for abelian groups

The Inverse Galois Problem is a fundamental question in mathematics that seeks to determine

extension over the rational numbers.

### Ore's theorem

This important, though not very well-known, theorem states that any finite solvable group 
$G$ is isomorphic to a quotient of a group of the form

where $U$ is nilpotent and $S$ is a solvable group of order less than $|G|$. 
This result is a consequence of Frattini’s work and has applications in Galois theory

### Using wreath products to prove theorems

Wreath products are formed through a specific combination of groups, 
similar in spirit to the construction of semidirect products. 
Despite their significant applications, wreath products are often overlooked in introductory courses. 
The goal of this project is to define wreath products, 
provide examples, and use them to prove easily some nice theorems.

characteristic zero.

### Projective modules

Projective modules generalize free modules in algebra. 
A module $P$ is projective if homomorphisms from $P$ can be ``lifted'' through 
surjective maps. They're direct summands of 
free modules and essential for homological algebra, representation theory 
and algebraic topology.
