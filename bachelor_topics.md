### Representations of (some) Lie algebras

The Lie algebra 
${\frak sl}_2({\Bbb C})$ of all matrices whose trace is zero 
is a fundamental object in the study of Lie algebras and plays a crucial role in understanding more complicated structures. In addition to its significance in physics, it possesses a rich representation theory that serves as a blueprint for understanding more general cases.

### The Cauchy—Davenport theorem in finite groups 

Let $p$ be a prime number. If $A$ and $B$ are non-empty subsets of the set $\mathbb{Z}/p$ of integers modulo $p$, then 
$|A+B|\geq\min\lbrace p,|A|+|B|-1\rbrace$. 
This sharp bound is known as the Cauchy—Davenport theorem. 
Remarkably, the theorem can be generalized to any finite group!

### Finite Nilpotent groups
 
In group theory, we learned that every finite abelian group decomposes
as a direct product of its Sylow subgroups. Which other finite groups
satisfy this property? Spoiler alert: precisely the finite nilpotent
groups. Although their definition is somewhat technical, they
generalize abelian groups in many ways.
This project studies several equivalent characterizations of finite
nilpotent groups and includes explicit computations for small
examples.

### Chebyshev's curves and singular points 

A classical theorem in the theory of plane curves states an irreducible algebraic
curve $C$ of degree $n$ in $\mathbb{P}_2(\mathbb{C})$ 
has at most $\frac12(n-1)(n-2)$ singularities. It is a very natural question
to ask whether, for each $n$, there exists irreducible curves
of degree $n$ that have such maximal number of 
singularities. A concrete family of curves reaching that maximal 
number of singularities can be constructed using Chebyshev's polynomials.

### The Schur—Zassenhaus theorem

Given a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, can we reconstruct the structure of $G$ from that of $N$ and $G/N$? In general, no. However, there is a crucial case where this problem has a beautiful solution: If the orders of $N$ and $G/N$ are coprime, then $G$ is a semidirect product of $N$ and $G/N$. This is the celebrated Schur—Zassenhaus theorem. The proof is also enjoyable. It reduces the problem to the case where $N$ is abelian; in that case, one uses some basic group cohomology!

### It is all about actions

The idea is to study an elementary theorem (yet compelling) proved not so long ago by Deaconescu and Walls about divisibility relations among the set of orbits of actions by group automorphisms. The theorem is very elementary and has friendly and highly non-trivial applications.

### Hall’s Marriage theorem

### Permutation polynomials

Let $K$ be a finite field (e.g., the field of integers modulo a prime number $p$). The project is about “permutation polynomials”.
A permutation polynomial $f(X)\in K[X]$ such that the associated function $x\mapsto f(x)$ is bijective. In 1966, Carlitz presented a conjecture that motivated around 30 years of intensive research in permutation polynomials. Although there was an immediate success in some special cases, progress was made slowly over the next three decades until Carlitz’s conjecture was finally resolved in the affirmative by Fried, Guralnick, and Saxl in 1993.

### Combinatorial Nullstellensatz

An algebraic approach to combinatorial problems involves capturing some combinatorial structures using polynomials and arguing about their algebraic properties. This has led to simple solutions to several long-standing open problems.  One of the main tools in this context is Alon’s combinatorial NullStellensatz. Examples of problems that can be solved with Alon’s theorem are the Cauchy—Davenport theorem, and Kakeya’s conjecture for finite fields.

### Cross products only in dimensions three and seven

### Zsigmondy's theorem

Zsigmondy’s theorem is a result that often proves useful in various number theory problems.

contest problems.

### The Golod—Shafarevich theorem

Golod and Shafarevich proved this significant result in 1964. It results in non-commutative algebra, which solves several challenging problems (e.g., the class field tower problem). In combinatorial group theory, finding a counterexample to the generalized Burnside problem is crucial: For each prime $p$, there is an infinite group $G$ generated by three elements in which each element has order a power of $p$.

### Far beyond the Cayley—Hamilton theorem

The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that every square matrix satisfies its characteristic equation. 
The Amitsur-Levitzki theorem deals with products of $2k$ matrices of size $k^2$. 
The theorem is the starting point of a rich theory of rings with polynomial identities.

but attending a lecture by 
Emmy Noether converted him to mathematics.)

### Character theory of finite groups

Character theory of finite groups is a super fun topic, but we don’t have enough time to cover it properly in the bachelor course _Ring and Module Theory_. The plan is to study the basics of character theory and compute character tables of some finite groups. It's similar to playing Sudoku, only much better!

### Graph theory and the Amitsur—Levitski theorem

The Amitsur—Levitzki theorem states that 
$\sum sign(\sigma)A_{\sigma(1)}\cdots A_{\sigma(2n)}=0$
for all $A_1,\dots,A_{2n}\in M_n(\mathbb{C})$, where the sum is taken over all permutations of the symmetric group $\mathbb{S}_n$. 
There is a beautiful graph-theoretic proof of this surprising result.

FRACTRAN is a Turing-complete programming language invented by the mathematician John Conway. A FRACTRAN program is an ordered list of positive rational numbers and an initial positive integer. In this fantastic language, Conway learned how to write an astonishing prime number generator. Surprisingly, this FRACTRAN program is just a list of 14 rational numbers! There is also an interesting [video](https://www.uctv.tv/shows/Fractran-A-Ridiculous-Logical-Language-with-John-Conway-23320).

### The (curious history of the) Schwartz—Zippel lemma

This topic is motivated by [this](https://rjlipton.com/2009/11/30/the-curious-history-of-the-schwartz-zippel-lemma/) blog post. 
The fundamental question of identity testing is: given a polynomial $P(X_{1}, \dots, X_{n})$ of degree $d$, 
when is this polynomial identically zero? An interesting approach 
to this question appeared independently in the works of Schwartz, 
Zippel, De Millo and Lipton, 
and others. According to Lidl and Niederreiter, the first instance of this result 
was proven by Ore in 1922. The lemma also appears in the 
[PhD thesis](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/4061/1/Erickson_de_1974.pdf) 
of Daniel Erickson from 1974. This lemma now has several applications in pure mathematics.

### Herstein's theorem

A very nice theorem proved by Herstein

using the transfer map.

### An example of a P.I.D. that is not a Euclidean domain

It turns out that $R = \mathbb{Z}[ \frac12 (1 + \sqrt{−19})]$ is such an example. 
To show that $R$ has the desired properties, 
Campoli proves that the ring $R$ is, in his words, _almost euclidean_. It 
turns out that a ring is almost euclidean if and only if it is a principal ideal domain.

### Dirichlet's theorem

Dirichlet's theorem states that for any two positive coprime integers $a$ and $d$,

modulo $d$.

### The inverse Galois problem for abelian groups

The Inverse Galois Problem is a fundamental question in mathematics that seeks to determine

extension over the rational numbers.

### PSL(2,7) as a Galois group

Is every finite group the group of symmetries of the roots of a rational polynomial? This is the statement of the _Inverse Galois Problem_.

### Hilbert's irreducibility theorem

Roughly speaking, Hilbert’s irreducibility theorem says that if a rational polynomial $f(X, t)$ is irreducible when considered as a polynomial in $X$ over the field $\mathbb{Q}(t)$, then for infinitely many $t_0\in\mathbb Q$, the specialized polynomial $f(X, t_0)$ remains irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. This theorem is one of the basic tools in attempts to realize finite groups as Galois groups over the rationals.

### (Co)Algebras in (braided) categories 

We are all familiar with the notion of an algebra. Some of you may also know what a coalgebra is (in fact, its definition is in some sense more natural than that of an algebra). Both of these structures live in the category of vector spaces. A natural question then arises: how do algebras and coalgebras look in other categories? This very useful generalization can indeed be made, and the situation becomes particularly interesting when the category in question is "braided" (that is, when it has a natural way to interchange objects).

### ADE everywhere 

In his book on representation theory, Etingof writes: _If we needed to make contact with an alien civilization and show them how sophisticated our civilization is, perhaps showing them Dynkin diagrams would be the best choice_. What is a Dynkin diagram? These remarkable diagrams appear all over mathematics, even in the classification of the five Platonic solids! Why do they appear everywhere? Nobody truly knows, and that mystery is exactly what makes this such a fascinating bachelor project.

### The Herzog-Schönheim conjecture 

The Herzog-Schönheim conjecture is a beautiful and simple statement about how groups can be covered by cosets.

This bachelor project explores the conjecture, its known results, and the ideas connecting combinatorics and group theory.

### Ore's theorem

This important, though not very well-known, theorem states that any finite solvable group 
$G$ is isomorphic to a quotient of a group of the form 
$U\rtimes S$, 
where $U$ is nilpotent and $S$ is a solvable group of order less than $|G|$. 
This result is a consequence of Frattini’s work and has applications in Galois theory

### Using wreath products to prove theorems

Wreath products are formed through a specific combination of groups, 
similar in spirit to the construction of semidirect products.

The goal of this project is to define wreath products, 
provide examples, and use them to prove easily some nice theorems.

Semisimple rings are rings where every module is a direct sum of simple modules.

characteristic zero.

### Projective modules

Projective modules generalize free modules in algebra. 
A module $P$ is projective if homomorphisms from $P$ can be ``lifted'' through 
surjective maps. They're direct summands of 
free modules and essential for homological algebra, representation theory 
and algebraic topology.

### History of group theory

Group theory did not emerge as a fully formed theory; it evolved from the study of polynomial equations, geometry, and symmetry. From Évariste Galois’ revolutionary ideas to the classification of finite simple groups, its history is remarkably rich. How did these abstract concepts arise, and why did they transform mathematics forever? This bachelor project aims to explore the fascinating story behind the development of group theory.

### Quantum Calculus: what if calculus has no limits?

Wait... what? Yes, quantum calculus is just a version of calculus where limits
disappear and new possibilities emerge. In this bachelor project, you will
explore the foundations of $q$-calculus, working with $q$-derivatives and
$q$-integrals. These ideas go back to Euler and Jacobi, and were recently
rediscovered through itsapplications in quantum mechanics. If you are ready to
see calculus from a fresh algebraic perspective, this project is for you.

### Did Hilbert invented Ramsey-theory?

Hilbert’s original proof of his celebrated irreducibility theorem uses the
so-called _cube lemma_. This is a kind of generalization of the pigeonhole
principle and represents the earliest appearances of a Ramsey-type
theorem, even before the works of Schur and van der Waerden.

### Why is $\pi$ irrational?  

We all know that $\pi$ is irrational, don’t we? Fewer people may know that
there is a simple proof given by Niven in the 1940s. This beautiful proof is,
however, somewhat magical, and like much magic, it feels rather unnatural. The
aim of this project is to present a proof of the irrationality of $\pi$ that
explains Niven’s _magical_ tricks by using orthogonal polynomials, an approach
developed more recently by Chow.

### Quadratic reciprocity and permutations

The quadratic reciprocity theorem was first conjectured by Euler and Legendre
and later proved by Gauss. The theorem provides conditions for the solvability
of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers. Because of its importance, Gauss
called it *the golden theorem* and provided six different proofs. There are now
around 250 known proofs. Students are free to choose whichever proof they
prefer. However, I would suggest presenting Zolotarev’s proof, which is based
on the sign of permutations and was presented as a game by Matthew Baker on his 
[blog](https://mattbaker.blog/2013/07/03/quadratic-reciprocity-and-zolotarevs-lemma/).
