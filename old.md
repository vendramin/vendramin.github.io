### Dedekind-finite rings

A ring is said to be a _Dedekind-finite_ ring if $ab = 1$ implies $ba = 1$ for any two elements $a$ and $b$. 
Several classes of rings are known to be Dedekind-finite. 
There is a beautiful theorem of Kaplansky that states that if an element of a 
ring has more than one right inverse, then it in fact has infinitely many.

### The Jones polynomial

In 1984 Jones discovered a new invariant of knots. The invariant assigns to each oriented knot (or link)  
a Laurent polynomial with integer coefficients. This invariant is surprisingly simple and extremely 
powerful. And Jones’ discovery was crucial in solving some old-and-famous 
200-years-old conjectures.
